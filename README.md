# AppSystemizer
This module converts a pre-defined list of installed apps to system apps (systemlessly, as in without modifying your /system partition, thru magisk). Now comes with companion app, which lets you pick any of the user-installed apps to be converted to a system app (you'll need to reboot twice to "systemize" apps you select). If you want full control over which apps do/do not get systemized, you'll need to edit the ```/magisk/AppSystemizer/extras/appslist.conf``` text file. [Support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3477512).

## Supported Apps
Only the following launchers are systemized by default. If you need to systemize other apps, use the companion App Systermizer application.
* Action Launcher 3 (for Google Now integration)
* Nexus/Pixel C Launcher (for Google Now integration)

#### Supported Apps which no longer require to be systemized
* GSam Battery Monitor and GSam Battery Monitor Pro
