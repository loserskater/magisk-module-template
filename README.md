# AppSystemizer
This module converts user-installed apps to system apps (systemlessly thru magisk, without modifying your /system partition). Now comes with companion App Systemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater), which lets you pick any user-installed app to be converted to a system app. [Support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3477512).

## Supported Apps
Only the following launchers are systemized by default. If you need to systemize any other user-installed apps, use the included companion App Systemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater).
* Action Launcher 3 (for Google Now integration)
* Nexus/Pixel C Launcher (for Google Now integration)
